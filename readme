A quiz companion to 
The Python Essential Reference 4th edition
will need to check that this is ok with ddabeaz if I crib anything more

other:

how to make multiple expression lambdas?

how to run Python code directly from the command line?

how to exit a program despite having non-daemon threads running? (os._exit())

draw out an object graph (OPT-style) of something complicated

what python statements have else clauses

other useful builtin iterators from Ned's talk: os.path



I think you should know a lot of this stuff within a month of learning Python,
but maybe longer if Python is your first programming language


Following the outline of Python Essential reference:
====================================================

Everytihng in the next section:  you should know it!

cursory introduction

Tutorial Introduction
---------------------

If you're going to use Python for just one project


what does _ do at the interactive prompt?

How to make programs executable?

// vs /

How to exit the program? (quit, exit, raise SystemExit, sys.exit())

print several things: (print a, b, c)

reassigning variables

semicolons to separate statements

how does indentation work? (any amount as long as it's consistent within the block)

basic format and % formatting syntax
    print format(year,"3d"),format(principal,"0.2f")
    print "{0:3d} {1:0.2f}".format(year,principal)


line wrapping rules

f = open()
file and stdin/stdout/stderr methods
raw_input vs input

tripple quoted strings

slicing of strings
reverse a string
str vs repl

draw some object graphs with lists

build a structure from a drawing

(basic) list comprehension


tuples without parens

zero and one element tuple syntax


Tuples and lists: Which takes less memory? How much less? which graph describes?


''.split()

# File containing lines of the form "name,shares,price"
filename = "portfolio.csv"
portfolio = []
for line in open(filename):
    fields = line.split(",") # Split each line into a list
    name = fields[0] # Extract and convert individual fields
    shares = int(fields[1])
    price = float(fields[2])
    stock = (name,shares,price) # Create a tuple (name, shares, price)
    portfolio.append(stock)


a = t | s # Union of t and s
b = t & s # Intersection of t and s
c = t – s # Set difference (items in t, but not in s)
d = t ^ s # Symmetric difference (items in t or s, but not both)


Dictionaries - in, .get, list(dict), 


iteration

third argument to range


iterate over files, dicts, sets, lists, strings, jk

tuple unpacking

invoke arguments using names of args

modify global variables in functions



generators - the yield keyword
they have "next"
this works in for loops

how would you write `tail`?

How would you write grep?

tail grep

Coroutines - generators that take data
syntax for this
choose a use case example

write one

objects and classes

list methods etc. with dir

know what type with type

know the + -> __add__ correspondence

write a method

staticmethods



Exceptions

with file

with lock

why are these useful for exceptions?


all the different imports

dir again

help(obj)

.__doc__

pydoc command line tool
